Bugs:
1) ?

Things to do:
1) Feasibility testing. (is it doing what it should be doing?) What about if sources/sinks co-located? What about multiple sources at same location?

2) Performance testing. (how does it compare to optimal?)

3) Write paper.

4) Improve algorithm solution performance. Ideas: Different selection criteria beyond just cheapest per ton of CO2. Reconsider negative edge costs. After algorithm is done, use the selected sources and sinks, but recompute pipeline network (Steiner tree / metric closure?).

5) Improve algorithm running time performance.

6) Determine algorithm theoretical performance. Approximation ratio? Comparison to greedy facility location solutions?

7) Name algorithm. Greedy Cheapest Pair (GCP)
