Bugs:
1) If target capture is no feasible, it gets as much as it can and then fails. Maybe it should print an error right off the bat, or do all it can and then print an error.
2)

Things to do:
1) Feasibility testing. (is it doing what it should be doing?) What about if sources/sinks co-located? What about multiple sources at same location?

2) Performance testing. (how does it compare to optimal?)

3) Write paper.

4) Improve algorithm solution performance. Ideas: Different selection criteria beyond just cheapest per ton of CO2. Reconsider negative edge costs. After algorithm is done, use the selected sources and sinks, but recompute pipeline network (Steiner tree / metric closure?). 

5) Improve algorithm running time performance.Possibly update shortest path algorithm. Other ideas:
	- Once a source/sink is maxed out, remove it from the least cost array.
	- Only calculate the shortest paths once? This will impact the quality of solution, but may still be reasonable.
	- (started 2/21) Make shortest path operate on double array instead of object array.
	- (started 2/21) Predetermine neighbors instead of searching each run of shortest path.


6) Determine algorithm theoretical performance. Approximation ratio? Comparison to greedy facility location solutions? Weighted Set-Cover.

7) Name algorithm. Greedy Cheapest Pair (GCP)
